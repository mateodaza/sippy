## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **"About" Command - What is Sippy?** ⭐⭐⭐

**New Command**: `about`, `what is sippy`, `whats sippy`

**Message**:

```
💧 What is Sippy?

Sippy is a WhatsApp crypto wallet that makes sending PYUSD
as easy as sending a text message!

✨ Key Features:

⛽ Auto Gas Refuel
We cover your gas fees daily! No need to worry about ETH for
transactions. Just send PYUSD and we handle the rest.

📱 Phone-to-Phone Transfers
Send money to any phone number. No wallet addresses needed!

🔒 Secure & Simple
Powered by Coinbase CDP wallets on Arbitrum. Your funds are
safe and transactions are fast.

💵 PYUSD Stablecoin
Always $1 = 1 PYUSD. No volatility, just stable value.

🆓 Daily gas refills mean you can send money without worrying
about transaction fees!

Send "help" to see all commands.
```

**Why It Matters**:

- Explains the refuel system clearly
- Highlights key UX benefits (phone-to-phone, daily gas)
- Builds trust (Coinbase, Arbitrum)
- Emphasizes simplicity

### 2. **Gas Warning with Daily Refuel Info** ⭐⭐

**Feature**: Low gas balance warning in `balance` command

**Triggers when**: ETH balance < 0.00001 ETH (matches contract's MIN_BALANCE threshold)

**Message**:

```
💰 Balance

ETH (Gas): 0.0001 ETH
PYUSD: $6.52
Wallet: 0x5Aa5...cde4

Add funds: https://www.sippy.lat/fund

⚠️ Low gas balance!
Don't worry - we refill your gas daily automatically.
If you need urgent gas, add ETH to your wallet.
```

**Why It Matters**:

- Informs users about low gas
- Reassures them with daily refuel info
- Prevents anxiety about failed transactions
- Gives option for urgent gas needs
